Keep doing yesterday's work

Monday we will distribute the parts of slides

Gather all works from weekend and integrate into system and test

After we finish our part's of code, we will send Paul our code (zipped).

When we send Paul M (dont want you to confuse him with me!!) our code, we will mention which page is changed.
